Nostr Pay is a mobile application client that enables users to connect to remote Lightning wallets using the Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) protocol.

## How It Works
Nostr Wallet Connect uses the existing Nostr infrastructure to facilitate communication between applications and Lightning wallets. This protocol allows for easy integration and provides users with flexibility in their wallet choices. For more details, refer to the [NIP 47 specification](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/47.md).
